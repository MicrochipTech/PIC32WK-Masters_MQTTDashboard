  Summary:
    SPI driver tasks functions

  Description:
    The SPI device driver provides a simple interface to manage the SPI
    modules on Microchip microcontrollers. This file contains implemenation
    for the SPI driver.
    
  Remarks:
  This file is generated from framework/driver/spi/template/drv_spi_dynamic_ebm_tasks.c.ftl
